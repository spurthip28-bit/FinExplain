# FinExplain📈
FinExplain is an AI-driven financial insight system that explains why a stock moved by integrating market data and financial news through a combination of rule-based analytics and transformer-based natural language reasoning.

It demonstrates how GenAI and analytical frameworks can augment financial analysts — turning raw market data into structured, interpretable insights.



## What it does
Given a **ticker** (e.g. `AAPL`) and a **date** (e.g. `2025-11-03`), FinExplain:
1. Fetches the price data for that day
2. Calculates the daily % move
3. Fetches (or mocks) news for that day
4. Ranks the news by relevance
5. Generates a plain-English explanation linking the move to the news
6. Returns a confidence score

## Why
Most finance projects stop at “sentiment = positive/negative.”  
FinExplain focuses on **explainability** — “*why did it move?*”
